Another College Project
Description:
Creation of a new Layout and Logo for a charity association. Later I had to develop the actual Website.
We had to create just 3 pages not a full site, just to create an user Journey.
Each pics scale down when you hover over and I applied also a grayscale filter
At the time I did not applied the mobile first approach, so first I made the layout for desktop and later I applied the mediaqueries for tablet and smartphone.
Technologies used:
Grid and Flexbox for layout and Lightbox for the images.
