              Volunteering with or becoming a member of Celbridge Community
              Council is a great way for Celbridge residents to increase their
              involvement in their own community. Celbridge Community Council
              supports and promotes many different community based activities.
              New members from many backgrounds and with many different skills
              are always welcome to participate in any way they can.

            <p>
              Celbridge Community Council has administered the Seniors Alert
              Scheme for many years. This scheme supports vulnerable older
              people in our community through the provision of personal
              monitored alarms to enable older persons, to continue to live
              securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of
              mind.

            <p>
              Celbridge Meals on Wheels delivers meals in the locality on a
              twice weekly basis. Recipients benefit through the improvement of
              their nutritional status, health and quality of life but also
              through the provision of a source of social contact and
              connectivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Celbridge Community Council supports this valuable work and tries
              to minimise the cost of these meals to recipients by obtaining
              funding from the HSE and by contributing to the shortfall in
              funding.
