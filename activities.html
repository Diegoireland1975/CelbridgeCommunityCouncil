                    <p>Celbridge Meals on Wheels delivers meals in the locality on a twice weekly basis. 
                        Recipients benefit through the improvement of their nutritional status, 
                        health and quality of life but also through the provision of a source of social contact
                        and connectivity.</p><p>Celbridge Community Council supports this valuable work 
                        and tries to minimise the cost of these meals to recipients 
                        by obtaining funding from the HSE and by contributing to the shortfall in funding.</p>
