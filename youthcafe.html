                          <p> The opening of Celbridge Youth Café realised a vision for young people in Celbridge that was conceived a number of years earlier. From 2005, Celbridge Community Council sought out interested members of the community and formed a team of volunteers. The volunteers decided that the youth facility would take the format of a Youth Café. In 2008, Celbridge Community Council agreed with The Mill to locate the Youth Café in an old welding workshop.</p><p>Workers on Community Employment Scheme placements completed most of the work of transforming the workshop into a Youth Café between 2008 and 2010. Young people and volunteers collaborate to run Celbridge Youth Café.</p><p>It began as a drop in space for young people in Transition, 5th and 6th Years. With support from new volunteers we were able to cater for a younger age group by 2012.In 2016 the Youth Café ran its first Summer Camp.</p><p>Following the huge successes of the summer camps in 2016 and 2017, we hope to continue these as an annual event.</p>
