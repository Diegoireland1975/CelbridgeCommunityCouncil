          <p>Celbridge Youth Cafe' opened in May 2010 as a place for teenagers to meet up during the week to have fun
            with friends. It's a place to relax and just have fun!.</p>
          <p>Community Council’s Youth Café sub-committee operates Celbridge Youth Café and it is affiliated to Foróige,
            the National youth organisation. Celbridge Youth Café currently opens on Fridays evenings from 7:30pm –
            9:30pm for teenagers in the area. Entry is only €3 in and that includes snacks and soft drinks.</p>
          <p>Extra times are organised throughout the week as different activities come up. Make new friends, watch a
            movie, play music, or play pool; whatever you feel like!
            We are open on Fridays 7.30-9.30pm for young people in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p> The opening of Celbridge Youth Café realised a vision for young people in Celbridge that was conceived a
            number of years earlier. From 2005, Celbridge Community Council sought out interested members of the
            community and formed a team of volunteers. The volunteers decided that the youth facility would take the
            format of a Youth Café. In 2008, Celbridge Community Council agreed with The Mill to locate the Youth Café
            in an old welding workshop.</p>
          <p>Workers on Community Employment Scheme placements completed most of the work of transforming the workshop
            into a Youth Café between 2008 and 2010. Young people and volunteers collaborate to run Celbridge Youth
            Café.</p>
          <p>It began as a drop in space for young people in Transition, 5th and 6th Years. With support from new
            volunteers we were able to cater for a younger age group by 2012.In 2016 the Youth Café ran its first Summer
            Camp.</p>
          <p>Following the huge successes of the summer camps in 2016 and 2017, we hope to continue these as an annual
            event.</p>
